                                            Family can also be bequeathed.</p><br />
                                        <h2>Q. Which other properties/assets can be bequeathed by will?</h2>
                                        <p>One can bequeath pets, paintings, antiques, electronic items, furniture &amp; fixtures,
                                            Intellectual properties like Trademark, Patents, Copyrights, Licenses, digital assets, Social
                                            Media Accounts, Personal Belongings, Books, etc.</p><br />
                                        <h2>R. How to protect interests of minor children?</h2>
                                        <p>One can nominate guardians for minor children who are beneficiary in the Will, and such
                                            guardian will be responsible to look after the minor children and protect their share until
                                            the child attains 18 years of age. Many a times, people create a Trust by way of Will for the
                                            benefit to all the legal heirs, friends, relatives or for charitable purpose.</p><br />
                                        <h2>S. What about assets that you missed or forgot to mention in the will, or future assets?</h2>
                                        <p>A clause is included in a Will for residual properties/assets (miscellaneous assets that were
                                            missed) which specify who should receive ‘residual assets’ and similarly a clause is added for
                                            ‘all future assets’.</p><br />
                                        <h2>T. Can the properties in foreign countries be bequeathed?</h2>
                                        <p>Properties situated in foreign countries are governed by local laws in those countries &amp; the
                                            procedure to enforce Will in such countries would be different from India. Therefore it is
                                            advisable to prepare two separate wills - one dealing with properties in India as per Indian
                                            laws and the other with properties in foreign countries as per local laws. Such Wills are
                                            called as concurrent Wills and are treated independent of each other unless interlinked.</p><br />
                                        <h2>U. Can Husband and Wife prepare one single Will as joint will?</h2>
                                        <p>Yes it is allowed where both the husband and wife bequeath all properties to each other
                                            and final bequeath is mentioned by which properties are distributed to family, relatives etc.
                                            as per Joint Will. However, such joint Will can take effect only after the death of both and
                                            not during the lifetime of either one.<br /><br />
                                            Many a times, husband and wife prepare ‘Mirror Will’ which are two separate individual
                                            Wills where each spouse gives all his/her property to their other spouse and mention third
                                            person as an Alternate Beneficiary.</p><br />
                                        <h2>V. Who can be a beneficiary under a will?</h2>
                                        <p>‘Beneficiary’ is a person to whom the properties are distributed or “bequeathed” under the
                                            Will, i.e., a person who gets the benefit under the will.<br /><br />
                                            Any person, body, trust, charitable institute, society etc. can be a beneficiary under the will.
                                            A beneficiary under your will can be your family members, relatives, friends, servants, etc.
                                            and you can opt to give your properties in charity.<br /><br />
                                            However Law has set-out procedure to be followed if you have close relatives and want to
                                            give all your properties and assets for charitable purpose. This restriction is not applicable in
                                            case of Parsis who can give all his/her properties in charity.</p><br />
                                        <h2>W. Who are legal heir?</h2>
                                        <p>Legal heir is a person; male or female, who is entitled to succeed to the properties of the
                                            deceased person under the applicable personal law for succession.<br /><br /><br />
                                            In case of a “will” being there: the beneficiaries of the will are the legal heirs.<br /><br />
                                            In the event of ‘No-Will’ situation, if there are only movable properties, a Succession
                                            Certificate is to be obtained from Court. If the person has left behind immovable properties
                                            also, in such case Letter of Administration is to be obtained from the Court.</p><br />
                                        <h2>X. Where can a will be stored /kept?</h2>
                                        <p>Legally a will can be stored at any place. However it is advisable to store your will at a safe
                                            and secure location where it cannot be tampered with and it can be easily found by your
                                            family after your death. It may be kept in the safe custody of a locker, with a trusted person
                                            or with professionals like banker or solicitor who will take necessary steps to inform the
                                            executor after your death. Various banks and financial institutions offer custodian services
                                            for safe keeping your will.</p><br />
                                        <h2>Y. Is Revocation And Alteration Of Will possible?</h2>
                                        <p>Section 62 of the Indian Succession Act clearly states that a Will can be altered or revoked
                                            by its maker anytime when he is competent to dispose of his property by will. A person can
                                            make a new Will as many times as he wants OR for few changes he/she can make a Codicil
                                            which is a Supplementary to the main Will.<br /><br />
                                            However, it is necessary to mention in your Will that ‘This is the Last will and all past Wills, if
                                            any, to be treated as cancelled’ since only the last Will is legally valid.<br /><br />
                                            One can cancel/revoke their Will at any point of time or even by making a fresh Will. Once a
                                            Will is made all the past/old Wills stand cancelled. A Will can be revoked in the following
                                            ways:-<br />
                                            i) By execution of a subsequent Will;<br />
                                            ii) By writing and declaring an intention to revoke the Will;<br />
                                            iii) By burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the Will.</p><br />
                                        <h2>Z. Are the Succession Laws Different for different religion?</h2>
                                        <p>Yes, this relates to the Succession laws where there are different laws applicable as per the
                                            religion of the deceased person.
                                            For example – for Hindus, it is the Hindu Succession Laws,
                                            For Parsis and Christians, it is the Indian Succession act,
                                            For Muslims it is as per the Sharia Laws (different rules for Shia, Sunni, Khoja etc.)</p>
